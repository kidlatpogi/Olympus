# 🧠 FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Development

This folder contains my ongoing journey through FreeCodeCamp's **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification**.  
I've organized it into two main parts:

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

| Folder         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PRACTICE/`    | Exercises and code samples created while following each lesson/module.     |
| `PROJECT/`     | Project challenges built as part of the certification path.                |

## 🏅 Certification

> 🚧 **JavaScript Certification In Progress**  
> I'm currently working through the lessons and challenges in FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript curriculum. This folder will grow as I complete more modules.

## 📌 What I’m Learning

- JavaScript basics: variables, functions, arrays, objects
- Looping, conditionals, and control flow
- ES6+ syntax: arrow functions, let/const, spread/rest
- Basic algorithm scripting
- Debugging and logic breakdown

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

I’ll continue building on this foundation by:
- Practicing more algorithm challenges
- Finishing certification projects
- Beginning Front-End Libraries next (React, Redux, etc.)
