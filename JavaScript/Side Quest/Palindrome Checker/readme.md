## 📘 Overview

This is a simple and stylish **Palindrome Checker** web app inspired by my first JavaScript project from FreeCodeCamp. I updated the design to give it a clean, modern look, and added comments to every line of JavaScript code for easy future reference.

## 🚀 Features

- Checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
- Supports punctuation, spaces, and mixed casing (e.g., "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama").
- Alerts the user if the input field is left blank.
- Works with both **click** and **Enter key** triggers.
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layout.
- Gradient UI with styled button and input field.

## 💻 How to Use

1. Type a word or sentence into the input field.
2. Click the **"Check"** button or press **Enter**.
3. The result will tell you if it's a palindrome.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with gradients and responsive design)
- JavaScript (with string manipulation and event handling)

## 📝 Future Improvements

- Add support for dark mode.
- Display a history of checked palindromes.
- Add animations or sound effects for feedback.
