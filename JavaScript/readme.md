# ‚ö° JavaScript Forge

This folder contains all of my JavaScript-related practice, projects, and certification progress. It's where I explore the language that powers dynamic web behavior ‚Äî from basic logic to real-world applications.

> üßæ This folder includes **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
> While the structure and styling are still important, the focus here is on building interactive and functional websites with JavaScript.

## üÜö Difference from `WebDev/`

| Folder     | Focus                               | Languages Used           |
|------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `WebDev/`  | Layouts, structure, and visual design | **HTML** + **CSS** only   |
| `JavaScript/`      | Functionality, interactivity, and logic | **HTML** + **CSS** + **JavaScript** |

If you're looking for pure layout/design work and early front-end foundations, head to the [`WebDev/`](https://github.com/kidlatpogi/Olympus/tree/main/WebDev) folder.  
If you're looking for interactive projects and scripting, you're in the right place.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

| Folder                             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`FreeCodeCamp/`](./FreeCodeCamp) | Practice files and project submissions created while completing the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification from FreeCodeCamp (in progress). |
| [`Side-Quests/`](./Side-Quests)   | Smaller, focused practice projects ‚Äî often done out of curiosity or to explore specific logic, functions, or effects. |
| [`Main-Quests/`](./Main-Quests)   | Larger, full-scale web development projects that showcase complete UI/UX behavior, interactive features, and real application logic. |

## üß† What I'm Working On

- Strengthening JS fundamentals (loops, functions, scope, arrays, objects)
- Practicing algorithms and logic problems
- Writing cleaner, modular, and reusable code
- Exploring ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, spread/rest)
- DOM manipulation and browser-based JS

## üöß Ongoing Progress

I‚Äôm currently working on the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript certification and actively building up this folder with challenges, mini-builds, and deeper understanding of core concepts.

Thanks for checking this out!  
This folder is part of my [Olympus Repository](https://github.com/kidlatpogi/Olympus), where I document all of my coding growth.
